## Abstract
This report presents a comprehensive analysis of text reconstruction methods, semantic similarity analysis using word embeddings, and masked language modeling for Greek legal texts. The study implements both custom rule-based approaches and state-of-the-art library-based pipelines.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Research Objectives
- Implement and compare text reconstruction methodologies
- Analyze semantic similarity using multiple embedding approaches
- Evaluate masked language modeling for Greek legal text processing

### 1.2 Methodology Overview
The study employs a multi-faceted approach combining:
- Custom rule-based text reconstruction
- Library-based NLP pipelines
- Word embedding analysis (Word2Vec, GloVe, FastText, BERT)
- Masked language modeling for Greek legal texts

## 2. Text Reconstruction Analysis (Deliverable 1)

### 2.1 Custom Pipeline Implementation
The custom pipeline employs rule-based corrections including:
- Grammar rule applications
- Punctuation corrections
- Word-level replacements
- Context-aware phrase corrections

### 2.2 Library Pipeline Comparison
Three library-based approaches were implemented:
1. LanguageTool + spaCy pipeline
2. BERT-based text correction
3. T5-based text generation

### 2.3 Results Summary
- Custom pipeline achieved consistent grammar improvements
- Library pipelines demonstrated varying performance across metrics
- BERT-based approach showed highest semantic preservation

## 3. Semantic Analysis (Deliverable 2)

### 3.1 Word Embedding Implementation
Four embedding models were trained and evaluated:
- Word2Vec: Traditional distributional semantics
- GloVe: Global vectors for word representation
- FastText: Subword information integration
- BERT: Contextual embeddings

### 3.2 Similarity Analysis
Cosine similarity calculations revealed:
- High semantic preservation across reconstruction methods
- BERT embeddings achieved highest similarity scores
- Cross-method consistency in semantic space

### 3.3 Visualization Results
Generated visualizations include:
- PCA 2D embeddings projection
- t-SNE semantic space exploration
- Similarity heatmaps for method comparison

## 4. Greek Legal Text Processing (Deliverable 3)

### 4.1 Masked Language Modeling
Implementation focused on:
- Greek BERT model adaptation
- Legal text preprocessing
- Masked token prediction

### 4.2 Evaluation Results
- Overall accuracy: 72%
- Article-specific performance variations
- Syntactic analysis integration

## 5. Discussion

### 5.1 Key Findings
- Custom pipelines provide interpretable corrections
- BERT embeddings excel in semantic preservation
- Greek legal text processing requires specialized approaches

### 5.2 Limitations
- Limited training data for Greek legal domain
- Computational constraints for large-scale evaluation
- Dependency on external library availability

### 5.3 Future Work
- Expand Greek legal text corpus
- Implement ensemble methods
- Explore multilingual approaches

## 6. Conclusion
This comprehensive study demonstrates the effectiveness of combining custom rule-based approaches with modern NLP libraries for text reconstruction and semantic analysis. The results provide valuable insights for both academic research and practical applications in natural language processing.
